Personally identifiable information (PII) is protected by GDPR; while a fantastic regulation for protecting individuals, can hamper innovation - new technology providers are unable 
to purchase or even view real data. This lack of access to data in turn prevents the technology company from being able to either develop their products or demonstrate their value 
to possible customers, such as banks, without months of legal work.It is in this space that synthetic data has its place, giving statistically accurate data but with no PII. Whilst 
there are many approaches to generating synthetic data (see H. Surendra, and S. Mohan, “A review of synthetic data generation methods for privacy preserving data publishing”, 
International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research, vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 95- 101, 2017.), GAN models are particularly interesting.

The goal is to produce data that better matches the original data, whilst successfully protecting the original data.In particular the CTGAN struggles with strings, if this could be 
successfully generated the data that could be given to fintechs and technology providers working with NayaOne would increase.
